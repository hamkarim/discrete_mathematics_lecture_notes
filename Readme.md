# Discrete Mathematics Lecture Notes

This project contains lecture notes for the lecture Discrete Mathematics at the Vienna University of Technology.

# Project history

Nearly everything you will find in this repository was done by students during winter semester 2013 (see the Authors information in the lecture notes for details).
During winter semester 2014 I (Wolfgang Wallner) set out to continue this work, and improve the lecture notes.
Unfortunately, I was struggling with several lectures at that time, and while I was in nearly every DM lecture and have handwritten improvements to these Latex files,
I never found the time to actually improve the Latex code.

If anyone is willing to continue this lecture notes project, I would of course provide my handwritten notes.
Contact me if you would be interested: wolfgang-wallner AT gmx.at

# General recommendation

Do not rely only on (this) lecture notes!

There are a lot of well-structured texts and lecture videos about the topics of this lecture available online.
I highly recommend to get a copy of 'Concrete Mathematics' from Knuth, et al.
